## LAB01
This lab contains the code for implementing the Insertion-Sort Algorithm.  
I had to take a user's desired array size and create an insert their data manually.  
Once the elements were entered, we would then sort the array.  
After each iteration of insertSort(), I had to print the sub-array.  

## LAB02
This lab contains the code for the implementation of the Merge Sort Algorithm.  
Similar to Lab 01, I had to sort the array of the user's desired size except in this lab, I use merge sort.  
The program ends when the sorted array is printed.  

## LAB03
To compile the code for LAB03 in the terminal you have to use the following:  

`g++ jhernandez613_2.cpp -o a.out -std=c++11`  

In this lab I had to find a sequence in an array where the net change is maximized.  
In other words, a subarray of A whose values have the largest sum, **the maximum sub-array**.  
So, in this lab I am not applying a sorting algorithm.
